> From director Gaspar Noé (Irreversible; Enter the Void; Love) comes a hypnotic, hallucinatory, and ultimately hair-raising depiction of a party that descends into delirium over the course of one wintry night. In Climax, a troupe of young dancers gathers in a remote and empty school building to rehearse. Following an unforgettable opening performance lit by virtuoso cinematographer Benoît Debie (Spring Breakers; Enter the Void) and shot by Noé himself, the troupe begins an all-night celebration that turns nightmarish as the dancers discover they've been pounding cups of sangria laced with potent LSD.

> While Big Mouth might not have the zip of Bob's Burgers, the sharpness of South Park, or the heart of BoJack Horseman, it is a ton of fun to watch and laugh along with, and a worthy contemporary of those animated greats.

> Disgusting? Sometimes. But it's all in service of a noble goal: providing one of TV's most honest depictions of growing up.
